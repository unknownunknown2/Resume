**Safety Alert Android App** 

- Designed app interface in Android Studio
- Android app that allows user to input the contact information of a network of contacts that can be alerted with the click of a button if any life-threatening emergencies occur in which the user cannot message or call, or becomes disabled
- Continuously sends updates to contacts with current GPS location, with corresponding address translated using Maps API, every 5 minutes until the alert is disabled 

**Stock Price Alert Android App** 

- A mobile app which allows users to input a portfolio of equity securities and corresponding high and low price limits (if any) and alerts the user if any of high and low price limits is reached
- Scrapes prices from a financial information website every hour and handles the processing and computation through a web server

**Movie Recommendation System** MIT Project  

- Built a movie recommendation system to predict movie rankings by individuals 
- First engineers features and then uses ensemble of various machine learning algorithms including random forest, SGD, Linear SVC, Passive Aggressive and fine-tuning deep learning models in Keras to predict movie rankings 

**NLP Classification Project** MIT Project  

 -First scrapes economics-themed academic papers by building a Python crawler
 -Secondly decomposes the abstracts into matrix form
 -Lastly classifies abstracts into topics/categories using NMF, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, ensemble of machine learning methods and deep learning models in Keras with 100% accuracy 

**Food Classification Project** MIT Project  

 -Classifies nutritional dataset containing thousands of food items with information on the amounts of calories, carbohydrate, fat, vitamins in each item and predicts the food category that items belong to such as meat and vegetables using PCA, K-means algorithm, and deep learning models in Keras with 100% accuracy
